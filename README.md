Discord - Private = I have it but I don't want any weirdos adding me.
Also I ain't ready for a discord server yet not enough fans.
When I hit 100 maybe I will create one.
Twitter - I had it but my account got wiped out again and again for some reason. I am not aware of causing any trouble, this happened to so much people most likely because I didn't want to add my phone number to it (AKA No way to identify me anymore and I hardly ever logged in anyway) Either way this website is extremely restricted I don't like it and I get annoyed about the limited number of letters you can write there.
Instagram - Same as Twitter (Loved it and it was fun while it lasted...)
Reddit - I have it but don't use it, should do but I'm too lazy to start on that platform, either way = https://www.reddit.com/user/xizorh
